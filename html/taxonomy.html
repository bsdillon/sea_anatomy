    <h2>Reading a Cladogram</h2>
    <p>
      When biologists disagree on the evolution of creatures, they use a cladogram to show the hypothetical relationship between them. Here we have two conflicting cladograms showing relationships between current species A, B, C, and D with older and possibly extinct parent species 1, 2, and 3. Answer these questions about the cladograms on the left and right. If you can't tell, just say so.<br><br>
      <img width="200" src="clad1.png" align="left"> <img width="200" src="clad2.png" align="right"><br clear="all">
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>According to the left cladogram, is A more closely related to C or D? What about the right cladogram?</li>
      <li>On the left, what is the most recent ancestor of C and D? On the right?</li>
      <li>On the left, did A separate from B before or after C separated from D? On the right?</li>
      <li>On the left, is D more recently evolved than C? On the right?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Even when biologists agree on which creatures are more closely related to each other, the time of separation is another factor to consider. A dendrogram shows the time of separation in a way cladograms do not. Contrast the cladogram with the dendrogram and answer the questions. If you can't tell, just say so.<br><br>
      <img width="200" src="clad1.png" align="left"> <img width="200" src="dend1.png" align="right"><br clear="all">
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>According to the cladogram, is A more closely related to C or D? What about the dendrogram?</li>
      <li>On the left, what is the most recent ancestor of C and D? On the right?</li>
      <li>On the left, did A separate from B before or after C separated from D? On the right?</li>
      <li>On the left, is D more recently evolved than C? On the right?</li>
    </ol>

      Finally, when all the evidence is in, a phylogram can show changes on each branch since a common ancestor. Contrast the phylogram with the dendrogram and answer the questions. If you can't tell, just say so.<br><br>
      <img width="200" src="phyl1.png" align="left"> <img width="200" src="dend1.png" align="right"><br clear="all">
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>According to the phylogram, is A more closely related to C or D? What about the dendrogram?</li>
      <li>On the left, what is the most recent ancestor of C and D? On the right?</li>
      <li>On the left, did A separate from B before or after C separated from D? On the right?</li>
      <li>On the left, is D more recently evolved than C? On the right?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Using Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
      It can be difficult to remember the right order for Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. The letters in a mnemonic device help us to remember important things in an easy way. Many people remember the order of taxa (plural of Taxon) using the mnemonic <b>D</b>ear <b>K</b>ing <b>P</b>hilip <b>C</b>ame <b>O</b>ver <b>F</b>or <b>G</b>ood <b>S</b>oup.<br><br>
      Try writing your own mnemonic.<br><br>
      <b>D</b>____ <b>K</b>____ <b>P</b>____ <b>C</b>____ <b>O</b>____ <b>F</b>____ <b>G</b>____ <b>S</b>____
    </p>
    <p>
      For each taxa that describes humans, find one creature in to the same group.

    <h3>Think like a biologist!</h3>
      Several creatures have been hard to fit into taxonomy because their characteristics are unlike their near-relatives and very like more distantly related species. Consider these examples. Which two of these species are most closely related?<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Bat, Pterodactyl, Gecko</li>
        <li>Duck, Beaver, Platypus</li>
        <li>Great Dane, Chihuahua, Agouti</li>
      </ul>
