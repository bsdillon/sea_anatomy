    <h2>Sponge Filtering Capacity</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
      Because sponges are filter feaders, their capacity to remove waste can dramatically affect the ecosystem. Let's consider a hypothetical species of sponge that filters 6 liters of seawater per hour removing an average of 0.15 grams of waste per liter.
      <ul>
        <li>How much detritus will the sponge remove in a 24-hour day?</li>
        <li>In a 7-day week?</li>
        <li>In a 30-day month?</li>
        <li>In a 365-day year?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Suppose that a single sponge in an enclosed environment like an aquarium. That environment measures 12 meters by 18 meters by 4 meters. Each has cubic meter contains 1000 liters.
      <ul>
        <li>How long will it take a single sponge to completely process all the water in the environment?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      More typically, several sponges in a colony will filter out the water together.
      <ul>
        <li>How many sponges would be needed to filter all the water in a single day?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Suppose that when the spongers are introduced there are 35.5 kilograms of waste mixed into the tank.
      <ul>
        <li>How long will it take for the sponges to completely filter the existing load of waste?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Fish and other animals excrete more waste all the time and the sponge is fighting to clear the water against the additional load. Suppose that thefish introduce 20 kilogram of new waste per day.
      <ul>
        <li>How long will it take the sponge colony to clear the tank?</li>
        <li>Use this table to show the waste load in the tank per day. Add more rows if necessary.<br><br>
        <table class="bordered">
          <tr><th>Day</th><th>Starting Load</th><th>Filtered</th><th>Added</th></tr>
          <tr><th>0</th><td>35.5kg</td><td></td><td></td></tr>

    <h2>Sponge Growth Capabilities</h2>
    <ol start="6">
      <li>
        Sponges have the remarkable ability to grow and reconstitute themselves even when damaged or cut into small pieces. Let's consider a hypothetical species of sponge that grows at a rate of 20.6% by volume per year. A sponge starts with a volume of 500 cubic centimeters.
        <ul>
          <li>How much will it grow in 1 year?</li>
          <li>In 5 years?</li>
          <li>In 10 years?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        After the 500 cubic centimeter sponge is reduced to fine particles, it begins to reconstitute itself at a rate of 10% of its volume per day.
        <ul>
          <li>How many days will it take for the sponge to reconstitute itself completely?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A biologist is studying a population of adult sponges. Every year, the biologist divides each adult sponge into two equal parts, which then grow back to their original volume (100%) within a year. This process is repeated annually. The initial volume of the adult sponge is 1000 cubic centimeters.
        <ul>
          <li>Create a table showing the number of sponges and sponge volume over five years.<br><br>
          <table class="bordered">
            <tr><th>Year</th><th>Sponges</th><th>Volume</th></tr>
            <tr><th>0</th><td>1</td><td>1000cc</td></tr>
            <tr><th>1</th><td>2</td><td>2000cc</td></tr>
            <tr><th>2</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><th>3</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><th>4</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><th>5</th><td></td><td></td></tr>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Suppose that the biologist is studying these sponges in an aquarium that measures 4 meter by 4 meter by 4 meter. Each liter of water is the same as 1000 cubic centimeters.
        <ul>
          <li>How many years would it take to fill the whole tank?</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Think like a biologist!</h3>
    <p>
      This is an example of exponential growth and as you can see growth on these lines would quickly fill any space.
      Obviously, that isn't happening in the wild or the whole ocean would be full of sponges. Something must be preventing
      exponential growth. Hypothesize five ways that sponge growth would be limited in the wild.
