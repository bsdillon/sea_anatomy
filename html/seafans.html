    <h2>Fractal Growth Patterns</h2>
    <ol>
    <p>
      Sea fans and sea pens grow using a fractal system. A fractal is a mathmatical recipe for creating complex shapes out of simple rules. Follow these rules to createa  Koch Star fractal. Start by drawing an equilateral triangle.
    </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Divide each line segment into three equal parts.</li>
        <li>Erase the middle part.</li>
        <li>Draw two new segments across the empty space and meeting in a peek facing outward.</li>
        <li>Repeat.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>
      Try these fractal growth patterns for 4 cycles. See how varied a fractal growth pattern can be.
    <p>
    <ol>
      Start with a single line.
      <li>Divide the line into three parts.</li>
      <li>Draw a large dot at the two intersections between segments.</li>
      <li>Draw a line 45 degrees to the left of the first dot.</li>
      <li>Draw a line 45 degrees to the right of the second dot.</li>
      <li>Both lines should be the same size as the three original segments.</li>
      <li>Repeat.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <ol>
      Start with a single line an inch long in the middle of your paper.
      <li>At the far end, draw a new line twice the length and at 60 degrees left of the original line.</li>
      <li>At the near end, draw a new line twice the length and at 60 degrees right of the original line.</li>
      <li>Repeat.</li>
    </ol> 
    <br>
    <ol>
      You will need two colors.<br>
      Start with a single yellow line an inch long in the middle of your paper.
      <li>For each red line, draw a new yellow line at 45 degrees right.</li>
      <li>For each yellow line, draw a new yellow line at 60 degrees left and draw over the old yellow lines in red.</li>
      <li>Repeat.</li>
    </ol> 
    </td><td>
    <ol>
      Start with a single line in the middle of and about half as wide as your paper.
      <li>Draw a temporary line at 90 degrees across the ends and middle of each line.</li>
      <li>Draw a new permanent line connecting the top left and middle right ends.</li>
      <li>Draw a new permanent line connecting the bottom left and middle right ends.</li>
      <li>Erase the temporary lines and the old lines.</li>
      <li>Repeat.</li>
    </ol> 
    <ol>
      Start with a half circle
      <li>At the open ends of any half circle, draw another half cirlce facing away from the center of the previous circle.</li>
      <li>In the middle of the half circle, draw another half circle facing either direction.</li>
      <li>Repeat.</li>
    </ol> 

    <h2>Budding Reproduction Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Fractals are an attractive growth pattern because it is easy to rebuild from even a small fragment. This is called budding. Select one of the fractal experiments and redraw a small portion of it on a separate paper. Follow the same intructions 3 times. What do you observe?
    </p>
    <p>
      Evolution says that small variations in our DNA can produce different results. Select one of the fractal experiments and alter one of the instructions. Repeat the experiment. How does your new pattern compare with the old one?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way that evolution can create variation is by combining DNA instructions from two different life forms. Select two of the fractal experiments and copy alternate instructions from each one to create a new pattern. Follow the new instructions for 4 cycles and compare with the parent patterns. What else did you observe?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these patterns cannot be combined because they are incompatible. Just as in nature, some combinations of DNA instructions do not work. Can you create a fractal pattern that will not work by combining these instructions in a new way?

    <h3>Think like a biologist!</h3>
      The family sertulariidae was originally confused with the sea fans which belong to the class octocorallia. It was later determined that the family sertulariidae belongs to the class hydrozoa. Look up a picture of sertulariidae, sea fans, hydrozoa, and octocorallia. Can you see why they were misclassified? What is the problem with classifying creatures based on appearance alone?
